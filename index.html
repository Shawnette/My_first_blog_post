            <h2>This is my first blog post</h2>
            <p class="main-text">     
                
            I would like to <em>emphasize</em> how important ths opportunity is for me. Let me tell you the story about my coding journey.
            In November of 2018 my sister Felicia told me that she wanted to enter a coding bootcamp. 
            She asked me to come over to her home as she was very excited to show me her newly found passion. 
            As I watched her learn HTML and CSS, I found myself very interested in coding. I decided to enroll in the same coding bootcamp. 
            This is a journey that I'm excited to take. I'm currently learning how to become a fullstack developers. I'm learning  HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python and React. 
            I have also started my journey into webdesign. This is such and exciting adventure and I look foward to introducing my new skills to the world. 
            </p>
            

            <h2>HTML is amazing</h2>
            <p class="main-text"> 
            As a new developer I have learned to make a to do list everyday. I have also created a vision board so that I know what my long term goals are.  This journey so far has taught me that dedication
            and hard work will always pay off. I have learned not to get frustrated when things seem difficult. I have learned that every problem has a solution. I'm thankful for this new opportunity. I've been utilizing many resources
            as an effort to learn the foundations of web-devolpment. I was recently asked the question "what type of developer do you want to be?" At this point I would like to start out as a front end devoloper. 
            After fully mastering the art of frontend development I will expand my skillset to fullstack development. Throughout this journey I have learned that one source is not enough to fully understand how to code.

            <h2>Case Study</h2>
            <p class="sample-writing">
            To demonstrate my ability to display my writing style. I am going to introduce you to one of my completed research papers cited in APA format. 
            This is a casestudy that I completed in graduate school regarding Apple Inc. 

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="introduction">
            The purpose of this paper is to explore the evolution of Strategic human resource management—and why it’s critical to the success of an organization— in meeting its goals and mission.  The case to be analyzed is associated with Apple, Inc. and their decision that holds relevant to strategic human resource and their mission to meet organizational goals.  The synopsis of this paper aims to discover a problem with Apples strategic planning and how their decision effects the human aspects of the organization.  
            Mello (2015) noted that effective organizations, realize the varied forces that unit performance, human element and the environment in which these forces operate.  Success of an organization is largely dependent upon adopting a strategic view of HR.  This perspective considers employees to be human assets and develops policies and programs that will essentially increase their value within an organizations.   Strategic management is a process that forces managers to realize that human assets are just as valuable as physical and capitol assets.  
            </p> 

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p class="analysis">
            Initially Apple started as a small garage project between two college drop-outs and grew to be one of the world’s largest organizations of tech savvy innovation.  The beginning of their journey was more than expected for a new company.  The company had an anomaly of great ideas and visionary motivations for the success of the company.  The most important strategy with Apple, was to constantly improve innovation and technology.  It seemed that they had developed an obsession to be the best and the most profitable computer designers.  After years of new ideas, some proved to be beneficial; while others failed to reach the level of profitability.  
            </p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p class="problem">
            The major issue that surfaced during the Apples quest was that Amelio had led the company through three reorganizations and payroll cuts. The problem is that Apple valued their physical assets and capital gain over their human assets.  Instead of utilizing the potential of their human innovative thinkers, their quest to be in the front of new technology created a major devaluation of their human assets.  Prior to the arrival of Steve Jobs, the managerial sector of Apple offered little strategy and was of vague importance.   Apple still continued restructuring after Jobs came on board.  They outsourced Mac products to Taiwan and created an online website to improve product sales.  As the pc world became standardized Apple continued it cuts throughout the research and development sectors (Sind & Yoffie, 2008).
            During Apples efforts to regain their position in the world of technology, they forgot about one key factor—the human factor.  The only human aspect that was at the forefront of development was their consumer base.  Several employees of Apple lost their jobs during their restructuring phase.  Apple failed to realize that human assets are merely impossible to duplicate which makes them the most valuable.   A company that fails to invest in its employees may have a difficult time retaining and recruiting new employees (Mello, 2015).
            Apple’s drive to build the best products in the technical world left little room for the development of key employees.  They failed to utilize the potential of their employees.  Each new innovative idea was created without little research or thought.  They came up with an idea and ran with it.  Improper planning and research often led to unfavorable results and the inability for them to meet their financial goals.   Apple was driven by blind ambition that offered little consideration to the human assets that helped them achieve great results.  
            </p>

            <h2>Recommendations</h2> 
            <p class="recomendation">
            An alternative course of action for Apple would have been for them to retain its current employees and to build upon their creativity and innovative idea.  They should have sent them out into the field to find out what the average consumer wanted.  Research and discovery is a key component in infinite growth.  The employees that were let go, had the skill set and knowledge that would have greatly benefited competitors.   Apple’s competition would have likely hired these individuals to gain innovative knowledge on the future goals of Apple.  
            The first recommendations is for Apple to establish a strategic plan of how they will accomplish their future goals.  This strategic analysis will include the input of their employees.  The next recommendation is to send scouts out into the field to gather research and to test the products of their competitors.  These test would prove very useful in designing a better product then their competitors.  Finally, the HR department and financial division should clearly establish a base pay rate as well as commissionable incentives for employees.  This would give employees the motivation to work harder at reaching strategic goals.  It will also create a comfortable budget to help maintain valuable employees.  The financial department would also analyze new business idea and create a projection of possible gains and losses.  
            </p>    

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="conclusion">
            Apple was developed in a garage with very little knowledge of how huge the company would become.  During the development stage, the company had innovative creators, financial resources and marketing ideas.  They didn’t spend a lot of time on developing their strategic human resource sector.  The most important factor in this case was their employees, they failed to retain, inspire and motivate them.  The motivation of developing a processor, iPod, or 3g network surpassed the motivation to continuously invest in human capital.
