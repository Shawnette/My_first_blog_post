    <h1>My first blog post</h1>
    <h2>This is my first blog post</h2>
    <p> I would like to <em>emphasize</em> how important ths opportunity is for me. Let me tell you the story how I learned to code.
        In November of 2018 my sister Felicia told me that she wanted to enter a coding bootcamp. 
        She asked me to come over to her home as she was very excited to show me her newly found passion. 
        As I watched her learn HTML and CSS, I found myself very interested in coding. I decided to enroll in the same coding bootcamp. 
        While working a fulltime job I found it very difficult to study after work. In February of 2019 I decided that I enjoyed coding so much;
        that I wanted to do more of it. I resigned from my full time job and decided to spend more time coding. This is course is one that I'm excited to take. 
    </p>


    <h2>HTML is amazing</h2>

    <p> So far I have found HTML to be very interesting and exiciting. I hope to learn many new languages and developer skills. This journey so far has taught me that dedication
        and hard work will always pay off. I have learned not to get frustrated when things seem difficult. I'm thankful for this new opportunity.
