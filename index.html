            I would like to <em>emphasize</em> how important ths opportunity is for me. Let me tell you the story about my coding journey.
            In November of 2018 my sister Felicia told me that she wanted to enter a coding bootcamp. 
            She asked me to come over to her home as she was very excited to show me her newly found passion. 
            As I watched her learn HTML and CSS, I found myself very interested in coding. I decided to enroll in the same coding bootcamp. 
            This is a journey that I'm excited to take. I'm currently learning how to become a fullstack developers. I'm learning languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python and React. 
            I have also started my journey into webdesign. This is such and exciting adventure and I look foward to introducing my new skills to the world. 
            </p>

            As a new developer I have learned to make a to do list everyday. I have also created a vision board so that I know what my long term goals are.  This journey so far has taught me that dedication
            and hard work will always pay off. I have learned not to get frustrated when things seem difficult. I have learned that every problem has a solution. I'm thankful for this new opportunity. I've been utilizing many resources
            as an effort to learn the foundations of web-devolpment. I was recently asked the question "what type of developer do you want to be?" At this point I would like to start out as a front end devoloper. 
            After fully mastering the art of frontend development I will expand my skillset to fullstack development.
